Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) means managing and provisioning computing resources through human-readable and machine-consumable definition files, rather than using physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

It is considered one of the essential practices of DevOps, along with continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), observability, and others. DevOps automates development and operations processes and creates a faster release cycle with higher quality.

Ansible is a prime example of a tool that enables organizations to apply IaC techniques to their DevOps workflow.

As an Ansible user, you define the desired state of your infrastructure — servers, cloud resources, networking — by using playbooks and roles that are expressed in YAML.
